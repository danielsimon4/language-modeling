**Language modeling notes from Andrej Karpathy videos**

While watching [Andrej Karpathy's great list of videos on language modeling](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ&si=P6YmUo5Wn5A_95cj) I created the following notes. Andrej Karpathy created [makemore](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore), a character-level language model takes one text file as input and generates more things, with the educational purpose of teaching a wide choice of language models from Bigrams all the way to a Transformer. Please note that the modeling approaches at the character level (predicting a character using the previous characters) are similar at the word level (predicting a word using the previous words).
